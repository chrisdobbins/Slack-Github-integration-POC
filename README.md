This is a proof of concept for a bot that notifies a Slack channel when a new release for a specific repo (this one) has been created on GitHub. To work, it requires a webhook for releases to be set up on GitHub. The webhook hits the `/githubwebhook` route for the server with a JSON payload describing the release. Upon receipt of this payload, the server sends a notification to a dummy Slack workspace set up for this purpose.
